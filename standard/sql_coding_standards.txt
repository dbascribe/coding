-- sql coding standards

1) general
The hungarian method doesn't fit here very well, because column headers are sometimes formatted in
capital letters. I prefer to seperate words by an underscore for better readability.

example:
first_name, last_name, zip_code

2)
a) constants
Constants are written in capital letters (at least it is more readable within the source code).

b) indentation
Three spaces

example:
first line starts here
   next line is indented with three spaces
